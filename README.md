I’ve learned a lot by solving these C++ problems. Initially, it helped me strengthen and clarify my CS101 concepts. I got a much better understanding of arrays, vectors, and strings,especially things I either didn’t know before or had misunderstood.As I progressed, I started learning how different STL containers like vectors, sets, maps, and priority queues work, along with their time complexities. These were completely new to me, and now I feel much more confident using them in real problems.One of the biggest improvements I’ve seen is in my debugging skills. Earlier, I used to get stuck on time related errors in my code, but now I’ve started learning how to properly debug and fix those issues.I also got introduced to greedy algorithms and dynamic programming, and I’m currently diving deeper into these concepts.Solving problems has really helped me think more analytically and it has also improved my problem solving skills.
